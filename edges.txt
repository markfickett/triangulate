# Edge measurements for a triangular lattice over the property line.
# The first endpoint is named by itself, and defines the origin.
A
# The second point only defines one line segment. Its position is picked
# arbitrarily.

# Subsequent points are in such an order that each completes a new triangle
# with the previous two points. Of the two possible solutions for each point,
# the one which is further away from the first endpoint is used.
