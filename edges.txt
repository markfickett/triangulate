# The first endpoint is named by itself, and defines the origin.
A
# The second point only defines one line segment. Its position is picked
# arbitrarily as on the vector 3pi/4 (45deg left of the y axis) from A.
B A 70.7107
# Subsequent points are in such an order that each completes a new triangle
# with the previous two points. Of the two possible solutions for each point,
# the one which is further away from the first endpoint is used.
